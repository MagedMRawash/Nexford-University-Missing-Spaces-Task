# Nexford-University-Missing-Spaces-Task
The missing_spaces.txt file contains paragraphs of English text with the spaces removed. Your task is to restore the missing spaces to the text using Machine Learning, producing a restored_spaces.txt file. The resulting file should contain the same number of lines, with no characters missing and no new characters other than spaces.  The training_data.txt file is provided for training.  The test_spaces.py script may be used for quality evaluation, as such: $ python test_spaces.py &lt;reference file> &lt;test file>  The script should also be used to check your result file is valid before submitting: $ python test_spaces.py missing_spaces.txt restored_spaces.txt (It should report 0.0 for Precision, Recall and F1 - but it shouldn't fail/error).
